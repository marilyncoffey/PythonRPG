You give one last, mighty swing, and bring your foe down to his 
knees. He's gasping for air and trembling with exhaustion.

"Holy crap," he gasps. 

You stand triumphant, and raise your arms to bask in your victory 
and the adoration of the crowd. However, instead of the expected 
thunderous applause and screaming, you hear a quick round of 
lukewarm, unenthusiastic clapping with nary a single scream. 
Slightly puzzled, you scan the crowd for a sign as to their 
unexpectedly cool mood. Where are your flowers? Your adoring fans, 
desperate to get even a second in your physical presence? You see 
no sign of gold or other prize winnings.

As you're trying to figure this out, you are pulled out of the ring. 
You see a second knight walk into the ring, and help his comrade up. 
They exchange a few words, and your former opponent gestures in your 
direction and shakes his head. He exits the ring with a slight limp 
as the newcomer shouts, "Next challenger!"

You see that a line of other people had gathered behind you, most of 
them small children, and one of them toddles forward, clutching a bent 
piece of cardboard in the vague shape of a sword. The knight draws his 
weapon, and, to your disbelief, challenges the child! Your surprise, 
and disquiet, only grows as you watch the fight commence. What should 
have only lasted a few seconds ends up with the knight on the ground, 
theatrically acting as if the child had bested! There's another round 
of (much more enthusiastic, you note) applause, and once again, 
you hear, "Next!"
