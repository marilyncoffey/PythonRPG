As you put your name on the list of contenders to fight 
the knight, you catch a glimpse of your erstwhile foe.
Well-made plate armor covers his frame; he's large, and 
covered with what could possibly be muscle. He pushes his
thick-framed glasses back up his nose, and you two lock 
gazes for a moment. He sneers at you, and you're suddenly
filled with a seething hatred. You're determined to wipe 
that smug look off of his face with your foam weapon. He's
going to rue the day he crossed fake blades with you!
