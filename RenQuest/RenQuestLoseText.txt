You've fought your hardest, but it seems to be for naught. 
You're exhausted, and barely able to stand. You feel like a 
stiff breeze would finish you off, and the knight barely even 
looks winded. He looks at you, and you see him roll his eyes. 
You know the finishing blow is coming, and there isn't 
anything you can do to stop it. As you close your eyes in 
surrender, you feel him jerk your weapon out of your hand. You 
open your eyes to see him placing the weapon under his arm, and 
he falls to his knees theatrically.

"You've defeated me, brave warrior!" he shouts to the crowd. 

They cheer and clap for you, and all you can feel is shame.

Your victory is hollow, and undeserved. You'd prefer a clean, 
honorable death to this. You hang your head, and leave the ring.
As you step out, you hear him shout out, "Next challenger!" As 
if this were just some sort of game to him.
