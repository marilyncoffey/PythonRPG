It is July 27th, a sweltering 90 Degrees and you hear the distant sounds
of bagpipes, horses, and what’s that? The clamor of armor and a crowd
cheering? Why, it must be Renfaire weekend! Grabbing your foam sword and
renaissance regalia, you excitedly head to the Massachusetts Renaissance
Faire.

Once you determine your place in this 16th century world, a child, adult,
LARPer, or Anime fan- you set off to the faire and hear of a new
prestigious quest- Fight the Knight! Being the huge geek that you are,
you know you must win this award or die trying!

The greeter at the gate has handed you a map of the faire and vendors.
The goal is to get all the best gear in time to fight the knight and win!
You can use your money (which is limited), charisma (to talk the price
down), or dexterity (to steal the items and hope you don’t get caught.)

Watch out for random events (like uber nerds and raccoons), and don’t
let your hydration level drop too low or you will pass out and have to
be taken to the hospital by the first aid tent. Marf the Dragon will
also help guide you on your way if you are not sure what to do next!

May the games begin!
